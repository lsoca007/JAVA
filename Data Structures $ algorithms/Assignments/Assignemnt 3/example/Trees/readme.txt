Unbalanced Map Time: 110530200 ns
Standard Map Time: 83603200 ns


Standard tree map is always faster than the unbalanced tree map. 
Because unbalanced tree map (Binary Search Tree) can not guarantee the balance of a tree. 
Hence, the tree can grow very larger in one side than the other one which produces inefficient searching operation. 
Balanced tree like AVL, RedBalck tree is effiecient in term of searching than BST.
